## Detalles

El próximo 7 de abril, el equipo de Lexicon presentará la evolución de su sistema de diseño para la creación de aplicaciones en Liferay. Hablaremos de cómo nos organizamos actualmente con los distintos equipos de producto y de diseño de componentes rígidos vs flexibles.

Además con motivo del evento, liberaremos la última versión de la librería de componentes para la comunidad de Figma en la que hemos introducido las nuevas funcionalidades de Figma: Variants y Auto-Layout 3.0. También compartiremos los últimos avances orientados a reducir la curva de aprendizaje en el onboarding de Lexicon.

he friends of Figma Barcelona hosted the event — this is amazing because they are a very active community that probably without the current situation we ever would meet. — It seems now it’s time for remote events.

## The hosts
Friends of Figma Barcelona is a community created in 2021 leaded by Iban Curdu and Carmen Ansio. They are such friendly people. We felt comfortable talking with them during the event. 

## The event
Before the talk, we were chatting informally with our hosts Iban and Carmen. Iban told us they would like to give a talk about the new feature of Figma: interactive components. So we started to talk about the playground file Emiliano did a couple of weeks ago. He opened the file and said, “this is awesome.”

Then a couple of minutes later, they introduce us. I started with the first part of the talk: a brief introduction of Lexicon, what it is, how we work, what plans do we have for the following years, and the central part of the talk about uniformity, how to fight it using flexible components. 

Next, Ruben started to show our new improvements in the Figma library. Variants, auto layout 3.0, and the redesign of the architecture.

The beers
:cry beers at home. They asked a lot of questions. A lot. We were like one-hour answering questions about typography, the performance problems they are experiencing with variants, how we test components, and our internal organization.

## Conclusions
We had a perfect time and we received very good feedback.

So, it was good to fight our demons. In my case, talking in public is always a challenge. But being honest, in my home, with no distractions, it was easy peasy. Not really :stuck_out_tongue:, but I’m satisfied with the result.

Thank you, Susana and María (our latest signing), for assisting the talk. We appreciate your support. 

It was easy peasy, next talk, here we go!
