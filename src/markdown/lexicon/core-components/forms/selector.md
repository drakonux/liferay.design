## Select

![select default state](/images/lexicon/Selector.jpg)

### Usage

This pattern is completely different from a dropdown. A Select is a native component with a data provider. A dropdown, however, opens a panel that could contain multiple and different natural elements.

### States

The states for a Select are the same as the states for a text input.
